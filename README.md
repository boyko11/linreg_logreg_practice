## Practice: Implement Gradient Descent for Linear and Logistic Regression with numpy

For the ease of readability, there is some overlap between the two files. The code could be made more reusable and object oriented since the Gradient Descent logic for both algorithms is identical. 

The code runs as expected with python 3.9 and numpy 1.22
